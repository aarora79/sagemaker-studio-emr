# SageMaker + EMR:  Warm Up 

To start our workshop, we're going to explore SageMaker Studio's ability to interact with EMR clusters. Studio gives 
data scientists, machine learning (ML) engineers, and general practitioners the tools to perform data analytics and 
data preparation at scale. From within the Studio IDE, you can visually browse, discover, and connect to Amazon EMR.
