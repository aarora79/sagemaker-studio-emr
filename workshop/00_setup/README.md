# Workshop Setup

Currently, this workshop requires you to utilize a temporary AWS Account pre-configured with the 
necessary AWS services. The underlying resources needed are available in this folder, and in the near future we plan to 
write the instructions for setting up and tearing down these services within your own AWS account.
