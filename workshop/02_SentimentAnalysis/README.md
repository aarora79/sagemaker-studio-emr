# SageMaker + EMR:  NLP Sentiment Analysis

In this lab, we're going to utilize our knowledge of connecting and interacting with EMR clusters in order to perform 
dataprep at scale for built-in SageMaker algorithms to train sentiment analysis models on. The clusters that we have 
provisioned up until this point have all been pre-loaded with Hive tables containing movie review data.

The Amazon SageMaker BlazingText algorithm provides highly optimized implementations of the Word2vec and text 
classification algorithms. The Word2vec algorithm is useful for many downstream natural language processing (NLP) 
tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, etc. Text classification is an 
mportant task for applications that perform web searches, information retrieval, ranking, and document classification.
